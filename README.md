# @swatk6/packet
A packet class for layer-agnostic communications.

For now, please refer to the inline JSDOC in the index.js file. Proper documentation is coming soon.

### A note for npmjs.com users

Please always refer to the docs at Github; if a change occurs only in the documentation (ie. this file), I'm not bumping the version of the package, therefore the docs at npmjs.com are not updated either.
